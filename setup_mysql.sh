#! /usr/bin/env bash

# Script name: setup_mysql.sh

# Description: This script:
# - installs MySQL (on a CentOS 7 machine) & creates the database & table needed
# for the Python Flask app, create-jazz-lyric.
# - runs as part of main.sh which ran: vagrant up & vagrant ssh
# - runs BEFORE setup_machine.sh, since setup_machine.sh depends on things done
# here first.
# The root password for MySQL you were prompted for when you ran main.sh:
# - creates a the file mysql_pw.txt on the VM, outside of this script, & puts in
# the MySQL password you gave into the file, BEFORE this script runs.
# - is put the file vs. in an environment variable, so it is on the filesystem &
# can be reused.

  # & from there, get all characters up to new line character & save as
  # MYSQL_TEMP_PWD. Note: This is 13 chars in from 'temporary password'.
  # -- expect part --
  # -f flag means to use a file & to use standard input as the file
  # -cÂ flag prefaces a command to be executed before any in the script

# TEST CASE 1: Manually uninstall MySQL client, db files, MySQL server, &
# server-related files with these commands & re-run script. Use these 4 commands:
#  sudo yum erase mysql  # Removes the client.
#  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql  # Deletes the database files.*
#  sudo yum erase mysql-community-server  # Deletes server config files.
#  sudo rm /var/log/mysqld.log

# *Note: # Data directory related to mysqld/the server.
# Database files store ALL .passwords including the temp root one &
# assigned root one. After the the MySQL package installation, you can't log in
# to MySQL with the temp root password which is in the /var/log/mysqld.log file
# and also in the database b/c you don't have access to either. So this script
# Note: MySQL DOES put the temp password in the /var/log/mysqld.log BUT only
# when it detects there is NO assigned root password.

# TEST CASE 2: Destroy this CentOS 7 VM with: vagrant destroy.
# Then create a new VM with: vagrant up.
# Then scp this file again & re-run script on the clean VM.
