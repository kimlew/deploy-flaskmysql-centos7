# TEST CASE 1: Manually uninstall MySQL client, db files,  MySQL server, &
# server-related files with these commands & re-run script. Use these 4 commands:
#  sudo yum erase mysql  # Removes the client.
#  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql  # Deletes the database files.*
#  sudo yum erase mysql-community-server  # Deletes server config files.
#  sudo rm /var/log/mysqld.log  # Data directory related to mysqld/the server.

# *Note: Database files store ALL .passwords including the temp root one &
# assigned root one. After the the MySQL package installation, you can't log in
# to MySQL with the temp root password which is in the /var/log/mysqld.log file
# and also in the database b/c you don't have access to either. So this script
# Note: MySQL DOES put the temp password in the /var/log/mysqld.log BUT only
# when it detects there is NO assigned root password.

# TEST CASE 2: Destroy this CentOS 7 VM with: vagrant destroy.
# Then create a new VM with: vagrant up.
# Then scp this file again & re-run script on the clean VM.
