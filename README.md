**Note: Created CentOS 7 machine locally with Vagrant**

## On Your Computer

1. In the directory for the VM/virtual machine/deployment machine, where you have the Vagrantfile, run this command:

  ```
  ./main.sh
  ```

## In a Browser Tab

1. The ports were forwarded in the `Vagrantfile` to port `8084`, so check that the app is running at: <http://localhost:8084/>
